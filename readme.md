# comp6841: rootkit

This project is based off of [Designing BSD Rootkits]( 
http://www.nostarch.com/rootkits.html) by Joseph Kong

There are two LKD's (Loadable Kernel Modules):

* Keylogger which saves characters to /tmp/arf
* mkdir which changes uid to 0 (making you root) when `mkdir abra` is given
